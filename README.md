# Student-s-capital
This is a CLI application done via C++ that simulates the process of buying, fixing, and selling laptops to maximize your capital over the summer. The user is allowed to choose the starting parameters and according to them the program finds the most appropriate way of selling laptops and outputs the maximal capital the student can get from it.

# Instructions 
What to do to run the application:
1. Find the "run" file in the test_task folder and copy the full location of the folder it's in.
2. Open the Windows Terminal or a console and execute the following command:
cd [address that you copied]
If everything was done correctly, you should see the correct address at the beginning of each line now.
3. Execute the ./run command to test the code.
4. The program should successfully work in the console.

P.S. The variable K is always a random amount from 2 to 10. If you want to change this, edit the definition of the K variable in line 93 of the source code.

All of the source code can be found in the test_task folder under the name test_task.cpp. The code has comments that provide explanation for different realization aspects of the program.
